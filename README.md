AI Assistant CLI (Python + OpenAI API)
A simple and extendable AI assistant that runs in your terminal using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o model. Built with Python, this project showcases how to chat with an LLM and extend its abilities using custom tools (a.k.a. function calling).

Conversational AI: Chat with GPT-4o-mini directly in your terminal.

Function Calling Support: Integrate tools like get_current_time() to let the AI use external functions when needed.

Environment-Aware: Loads secrets like your API key from .env using python-dotenv.
